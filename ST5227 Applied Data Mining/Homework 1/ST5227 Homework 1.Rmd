This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
data = read.table('data01C.dat')

x = data[,1]
y = data[,2]

reg = lm(y~x)


newx = seq(min(x), max(x), 0.1)
pred <- predict(reg, newdata=data.frame(x=newx), interval="confidence", 
                         level = 0.95) 

plot(x, y)
abline(reg, lwd=2)
lines(newx, pred[,2], lty=3, col='red', lwd=2)
lines(newx, pred[,3], lty=3, col='red', lwd=2)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
